## **Supplementary Materials**

Taking the **Instance01** for example, and the folder structure of the other instacens is similar.

- bim_data.rvt: Revit file for BIM data
- bim_data_figure.jpg: for a quick glance
- bim_data.json: HSL approach's input extracted from interface language
- bim_data_random_barriers.json: used in Simulation 3 with additional random barriers

## Simulation 1:
- simulation1/HSL
- simulation1/ILP Global
- simulation1/ILP Local
## Simulation 2:
- simulation2/HSL-Random
- simulation2/HSL-Reverse
## Simulation 3:
